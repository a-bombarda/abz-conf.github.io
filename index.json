The following three ingredients of the method support to develop executable code from specifications by stepwise refinement where at each step both mathematical verification of desired properties and experimental model validation by testing can be applied and fully documented to permit design for change.\n  the concept of ASM defined in [1], a semantically well-founded and arguably most general form of conceptually executable pseudo-code. The definition provides a uniform language to express any intended computational system at any development stage in terms of operations at an appropriate level of abstraction operating directly over objects (read: the system STATE, including input and output) determined by that level of abstraction.\n  the concept of ASM ground model defined in [2], i.e. a rigorous requirements model that is expressed in application domain terms. A ground model ASM turns natural language requirements into a mathematical form that supports the inspection of the model by both domain and software experts, whereby the intended correctness and completeness of the requirements can be effectively checked and documented.\n  the concept of ASM refinement defined in [3]. It permits to develop a system in well-documented controllable modular steps, linking ASMs at different levels of abstraction, say an abstract and a more detailed model, in a way the software engineer can justify as correct implementation step. The executability of ASMs supports using testing methods to validate the models whereas their mathematical nature allows one to adopt mathematical verification techniques where appropriate.\n  The entire set of refinement steps transforms a ground model into well-documented executable code. The model analysis at different levels of abstraction helps to avoid and to identify and correct fundamental design errors, which are difficult to detect and expensive to correct in code. The intermediate models also support model reuse and design (programming) for change.\nNote that the development process is by no means linear, as is illustrated by the following diagram:\nFor an introductory text book with lecture slides see the Modeling Book [4] or the Asm Book [5].\nFor case studies which illustrate typical applications of the method see the JBook [6] and provided case studies on this page.\nFor tools which support the ASM method see\n  Asmeta  CASM  CoreASM  AsmGofer  For the early history \u0026ndash; of the development of the method and early applications in various fields of computer science \u0026ndash; up to 2003 see [7] (available from https://www.jucs.org/jucs_8_1/the_origins_and_the/Boerger_E.pdf) and http://web.eecs.umich.edu/gasm/subjects/montage.html.\nThe epistemological motivation for the definition of ASMs was to improve Turing\u0026rsquo;s thesis, which has been proved in [2] from three natural axioms for sequential algorithms. For the further development of such axiomatic and corresponding ASM-characterizations of algorithmic concepts (e.g. recursive algorithms, reflective algorithms, synchronous parallel algorithms, concurrent algorithms, communicating algorithms, etc.) see [9]. In practice, this so-called behavioral theory of ASMs supports the arguably most general form of ASMs as system specification.\nThe ASM Workshop Proceedings 1994-2007 (preceding the merge of those workshops with the user meetings of Z and B to the ABZ Conference, started in 2008):\n@Proceedings{Asm94, title = {Technology and {F}oundations. {I}nformation {P}rocessing'94}, year = {1994}, editor = {B.

This document describes two systems from the automotive domain: an adaptive exterior light system (ELS) and a speed control system (SCS). This specification is based on the SPES XT running example[3]. Besides their general architectures, the requirements of the software based controllers are described.

The case study focusses on the management of fixed virtual sub-sections (VSS). We model the hybrid level 3 of the standard, which assumes that trains may be either equipped with an on-board train integrity monitoring system (TIMS) and that they report their position and integrity, ERTMS trains not fitted with TIMS that report only their front position or non-ERTMS trains that do not report any information about their position. We take into account most of the main features of the case study. Our model is decomposed into four refinements. All proof obligations have been discharged using the Rodin provers, except those related to the computation of the VSS state machine, which was found to be ambiguous (nondeterministic). Our model has been validated using ProB. The main safety property, which is that ERTMS trains do not collide, is proved.\nDocument    var url = \"https:\\/\\/www.irit.fr\\/ABZ-CS\\/html_files\\/files\\/2018\\/PDF\\/MFJFL_ABZ2018.pdf\"; PDFObject.embed( url, \"#pdfobject-viewer\" );   .pdfobject-container { height: 30rem; }  Reference % BibTex @inproceedings{DBLP:conf/asm/MammarFFL18, author = {Amel Mammar and Marc Frappier and Steve Jeffrey Tueno Fotso and R{\\'{e}}gine Laleau}, title = {An Event-B Model of the Hybrid {ERTMS/ETCS} Level 3 Standard}, booktitle = {Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and {Z} - 6th International Conference, {ABZ} 2018, Southampton, UK, June 5-8, 2018, Proceedings}, pages = {353--366}, year = {2018}, crossref = {DBLP:conf/asm/2018} }  Sources  Model Archive: ZIP Presentation: Not available Used formal method: Event-B Resources and tools: Rodin, ProB Required OS: Linux, Windows Website: http://info.usherbrooke.ca/mfrappier/abz2018-ERTMS-Case-Study Remarks and recommendation: Not available  ","date":1525132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639764499,"objectID":"e5814530a78bbedf2b810d864247fbdb","permalink":"/publication/mammar2018abz/","publishdate":"2018-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mammar2018abz/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract This paper presents an Event-B model of the ABZ2018 case study on the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) standard.

A broadly component based strategy is adopted, using the multi-machine and coordination facilities of Hybrid Event-B. Since, like most medical procedures, hemodialysis is under overall human control, it is largely a sequential process, with some branching to deal with exceptional circumstances. This makes for a relatively uncomplicated modelling framework, provided a model of the operator is included in order to capture the handling of exceptions.\nDocument    var url = \"https:\\/\\/www.research.manchester.ac.uk\\/portal\\/files\\/31402126\\/FULL_TEXT.PDF\"; PDFObject.embed( url, \"#pdfobject-viewer\" );   .pdfobject-container { height: 30rem; }  Reference % BibTex @InProceedings{10.1007/978-3-319-33600-8_32, author=\u0026quot;Banach, Richard\u0026quot;, editor=\u0026quot;Butler, Michael and Schewe, Klaus-Dieter and Mashkoor, Atif and Biro, Miklos\u0026quot;, title=\u0026quot;Hemodialysis Machine in Hybrid Event-B\u0026quot;, booktitle=\u0026quot;Abstract State Machines, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, and Z\u0026quot;, year=\u0026quot;2016\u0026quot;, publisher=\u0026quot;Springer International Publishing\u0026quot;, address=\u0026quot;Cham\u0026quot;, pages=\u0026quot;376--393\u0026quot;, isbn=\u0026quot;978-3-319-33600-8\u0026quot; }  Sources  Model Archive: Not available Presentation: Not available Used formal method: Hybrid Event-B Resources and tools: Not available Required OS: Not available Website: Not available Remarks and recommendation: Not available  ","date":1462060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639764499,"objectID":"e746082da7808d888cf6bfec6d86b1f5","permalink":"/publication/banach2016abz/","publishdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/banach2016abz/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract The hemodialysis machine case study is examined in Hybrid Event-B (an extension of Event-B that includes provision for continuously varying behaviour as well as the usual discrete changes of state).","tags":["ABZ'16"],"title":"Hemodialysis Machine in Hybrid Event-B","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paolo Arcaini","Silvia Bonfanti","Angelo Gargantini","Elvinia Riccobene"],"categories":[],"content":"Abstract Medical devices are nowadays more and more software dependent, and software malfunctioning can lead to injuries or death for patients.
