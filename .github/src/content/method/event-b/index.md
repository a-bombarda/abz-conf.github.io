Event-B is an evolution of (classical) B with a simpler notation. Similar to B a system is modeled by different abstraction levels that are connected by a rigorous refinement proven correct. Whereas the B-method is intended to the development of correct-by-construction software, the purpose of Event-B is to model full systems (including hardware and operation environment). These two languages share almost the same mathematical language.
