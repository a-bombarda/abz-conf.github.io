Classical B (or just B) focuses on a tool-based refinement of a formal specification to code. It is based on the Z notation but slightly more low-level. In B a system consists of an abstract machine in which the modeler specifies the goal of the system. Via several refinement steps, this abstract goal is enhanced by more details on a less abstract level by adding details about data structures and algorithms that define how the goal is achieved. 
All steps are proven correct until a deterministic version (the implementation) is reached.
