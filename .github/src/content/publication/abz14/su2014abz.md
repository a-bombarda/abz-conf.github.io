## Abstract

This paper describes the modeling, done using the Event-B notation, of the aircraft landing gear case study that is proposed in a special track of the ABZâ€™2014 Conference. In the course of our development, we discovered some problems in our initial modeling approach. This has led us to propose a second approach and then a third one. Each approach is more efficient than the previous one in terms of proof obligations (roughly speaking: 2000, 1000, 500). All this will be described in this paper. We also try to go beyond this specific case study and give some thoughts about large industrial modeling.
